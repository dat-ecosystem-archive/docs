## Terms

### Dat

A folder containing files of any type, which can be sent over the distributed web.

### Distributed Web

In a Distributed Web model, those who are downloading the data are also providing some of the bandwidth and storage to run it. Instead of one server, we have many. The more people or organizations that are involved in the Distributed Web, the more redundant, safe, and fast it will become.

Currently, the Web is centralized: if someone controls the hardware or the communication line, then they control all the uses of that website. [Read more here](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/).

### Peer

Another user who has downloaded the data (or parts of it) and is uploading it to others in the Dat Swarm.

### Swarm

### Secure Register

A [register]( https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/09/01/registers-authoritative-lists-you-can-trust/) is an authoritative list of information you can trust. We maintain an open register called [Dat Folder](datfolder.org) which contains public data, and is open to everyone.
