# Summary
[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of what this is about.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Usage Documentation
[usage-documentation]: #usage-documentation

Document new features or processes as if this proposal has already been accepted and implemented. This section should introduce new concepts and terms, describe use cases or situations, and provide examples. If a user-facing feature is added, this should also include user-accessible documentation.

# Reference Documentation
[reference-documentation]: #reference-documentation

This section is a more formal description of the proposal, written as if it was a sub-section of the standard (for techincal proposals) or a formal process or "fine print" for process proposals.

It should be unambiguous and cover all known corner-cases. Formal language (such as protobuf schemas or binary header diagrams) are appropriate here.
