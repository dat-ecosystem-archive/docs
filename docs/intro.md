# Welcome to Dat!

Dat is the distributed data tool.

A new class of data management software puts advanced file syncing and archiving wherever you need it. Dat goes beyond fragile http, centralized storage, and vendor lock-in with radically improved data verification and networking. Sync files between your computer and the cloud with ease, but store them where you want.

Share files anywhere using automatic version history, encryption, and live synchronization. Users connect directly for quick transfer and secure communication. Use Dat to distribute scientific data, browse remote files on demand, or run continuous file backup. **Secure**, **distributed**, **fast**.

**Built for the Public Good**

Dat is openly and compassionately built by a distributed team. All software open source and freely available to use. The [Dat project](http://datproject.org) is led by [Code for Science & Society](http://codeforscience.org) (CSS), a U.S. nonprofit. The mission of CSS is to work with public institutions to produce open source infrastructure for researchers, civic hackers, and journalists to improve data access and long-term preservation. We actively welcome outside contributors and use cases beyond our mission.

Code for Science & Society also hosts other open science initiatives including [Science Fair](https://github.com/codeforscience/sciencefair/), a desktop science library like nothing before, and [Stencila](https://github.com/stencila), the office suite for reproducible research. Science Fair uses Dat to distribute scientific literature. In the future, Stencila will use Dat for reproducible data analysis.

## Features

* **Secure** - Data transfer is encrypted and content is verified on arrival. Dat prevents third-party access to metadata and content. [Learn more](faq#security-and-privacy) about security & privacy.
* **Distributed** - Connect directly to other users sharing or downloading common datasets. Any device can share files without need for centralized servers. [Read more](terms#distributed-web) about the distributed web.
* **Fast** - Share files instantly with in-place archiving. Download only the files you want. Quickly sync updates by only downloading new data, saving time and bandwidth.
* **Transparent** - A complete version history improves transparency and auditability. Changes are written in append-only logs and uniformly shared throughout the network.
* **Future-proof** - Persistent links identify and verify content. These unique ids allow users to host copies, boosting long-term availability without sacrificing provenance.
