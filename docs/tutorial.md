## Tutorial 

In this tutorial we will go through the two main ways to use Dat, sharing data and downloading data. If possible, this is great to go through with a partner to see how Dat works across computers. Get Dat [installed](intro#installation) and get started!

Dat Desktop makes it easy for anyone to get started using Dat with user-friendly interface. If you are comfortable with the command line then you can install dat via npm. No pressure! You can always switch apps later and keep your dats the same. Dat can share your files to anyone without caring how they are using Dat.

### Sharing Data

We'll be creating a dat from a folder on your computer. If you are with a friend you can sync these files to their computer. Otherwise you can view them online via datproject.org to see how viewing a dat online works (datproject.org does only stores data as a temporary cache, not permanently). Any kind of files work with Dat but for now, make sure it's something you want to share with your friends. We like cat pictures.
