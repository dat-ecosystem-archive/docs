Dat is a distributed data sharing tool. Dat's mission is to make public data sharing easier and more sustainable. We built Dat for security and speed, making it great for many file transfer needs. Code for Science & Society, a nonprofit, leads the Dat project. Dat also has a vibrant global community of developers building apps on the Dat protocol.

Dat wants you to control how you share and publish files, without sacrificing privacy or ease of use.

#### Use Dat for:

* Researchers can use Dat's ***automatic version history*** for reproducible analysis.
* Libraries can use Dat's ***distributed network*** to cooperatively preserve files, without siloing data.
* Journalists and activists can use Dat's ***secure*** peer to peer network to share files directly.

#### How to use Dat:

* [Install Dat](/install)
* Use Dat to share any folder on your computer or external hard drive.
* Dat will create a dat permanent link for your folder.
* Use that link or send it to others to download the files on another computer. File updates transfer live as long as you keep sharing.

### Why is Dat different?

#### Distributed Network

Dat works on a distributed network unlike cloud services, such as Dropbox or Google Drive. This means Dat transfers files peer to peer, skipping centralized servers. Dat's network makes file transfers faster and more secure. You can even use Dat on local networks for offline file sharing or local backups. For people hosting data, Dat reduces bandwidth costs on popular files.

#### Automatic Version Control

Dat makes it easy for you to save old versions of files. With every file update, Dat automatically tracks your changes. You can store file changes efficiently on an external hard drive or a cloud server. Use Dat's http hosting to create a versioned website of your files, great for publishing scientific data.

#### Security

Dat transfers files over an encrypted connection. Only users with your unique link can access your files. Your dat link allows users to download, and re-share, your files. To write updates to a dat, users must have the secret key. Dat also verifies the hashes of files on download so no malicious content can be added.
