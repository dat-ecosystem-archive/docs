You can chat with us on [Gitter][gitter-chat]!

## Getting Started

Dat's unique design works wherever you store your data.
You can create a new dat from any folder on your computer.

A dat is some files from your computer and a `.dat` folder. Each dat has a unique `dat://` link.
With your dat link, other users can download your files and live sync any updates.

### Sharing Data

You can start sharing your files with a single command.
Unlike `git`, you do not have to initialize a repository first, `dat share` will do that for you:

```
dat share <dir>
```

Use `dat share` to create a dat and sync your files from your computer to other users.
Dat scans your files inside `<dir>`, creating metadata in `<dir>/.dat`.
Dat stores the public link, version history, and file information inside the dat folder.

### Downloading Data

```
dat clone dat://<link> <download-dir>
```

Use `dat clone` to download files from a remote computer sharing files with Dat.
This will download the files from `dat://<link>` to your `<download-dir>`.
The download exits after it completes but you can continue to update the files later after the clone is done.
Use `dat pull` to update new files or `dat sync` to live sync changes.

Try out `dat clone` with the link above to read more about the protocol!

### Other Useful Commands

A few other highlights. Run `dat help` to see the full usage guide.

* `dat create` - Create an empty dat and `dat.json` file.
* `dat doctor` - Dat network doctor! The doctor tries to connect to a public peer. The doctor also creates a key to test direct connections.
* `dat log ~/data/dat-folder/` or `dat log dat://<key>` - view the history and metadata information for a dat.

### Quick Demos

To get started using Dat, you can try downloading a dat and then sharing a dat of your own.

#### Download Demo

We made a demo folder just for this exercise.
Inside the demo folder is a `dat.json` file and a gif.
We shared these files via Dat and now you can download them with our dat key!

Similar to git, you can download somebody's dat by running `dat clone <link>`.
You can also specify the directory:

```
‚ùØ dat clone dat://dat.foundation ~/Downloads/dat-demo
dat v13.13.1
Created new dat in /Users/Jestre/Downloads/dat-demo/.dat
Cloning: 169 files (2.4 MB)

3 connections | Download 509 KB/s Upload 0 B/s

dat sync complete.
Version 1302


Exiting the Dat program...
```

This will download our demo files to the `~/Downloads/dat-demo` folder.
These files are being shared by a server over Dat (to ensure high availability) but you may connect to any number of users also hosting the content.

#### Sharing Demo

Dat can share files from your computer to anywhere.
If you have a friend going through this demo with you, try sharing to them!
If not we'll see what we can do.

Find a folder on your computer to share.
Inside the folder can be anything, Dat can handle all sorts of files (Dat works with really big folders too!).

First, you can create a new dat inside that folder.
Using the `dat create` command also walks us through making a `dat.json` file:

```
‚ùØ dat create
Welcome to dat program!
You can turn any folder on your computer into a Dat.
A Dat is a folder with some magic.
```

This will create a new (empty) dat.
Dat will print a link, share this link to give others access to view your files.

Once we have our dat, run `dat share` to scan your files and sync them to the network.
Share the link with your friend to instantly start downloading files.

#### Bonus HTTP Demo

Dat makes it really easy to share live files on a HTTP server.
This is a cool demo because we can also see how version history works!
Serve dat files on HTTP with the `--http` option.
For example, `dat sync --http`, serves your files to a HTTP website with live reloading and version history!
This even works for dats you're downloading (add the `--sparse` option to only download files you select via HTTP).
The default HTTP port is 8080.

*Hint: Use `localhost:8080/?version=10` to view a specific version.*

Get started using Dat today with the `share` and `clone` commands or read below for more details.

## Usage

The first time you run a command, a `.dat` folder is created to store the dat metadata.
Once a dat is created, you can run all the commands inside that folder, similar to git.

Dat keeps secret keys in the `~/.dat/secret_keys` folder.
These are required to write to any dats you create.

#### Creating a dat & dat.json

```
dat create [<dir>]
```

The create command prompts you to make a `dat.json` file and creates a new dat.
Import the files with sync or share.

Optionally bypass Title and Description prompt:

```sh
dat create --title "MY BITS" --description "are ready to synchronize! üòé"
```

Optionally bypass `dat.json` creation:

```sh
dat create --yes
dat create -y
```

### Sharing

The quickest way to get started sharing files is to `share`:

```
‚ùØ dat share
dat://3e830227b4b2be197679ff1b573cc85e689f202c0884eb8bdb0e1fcecbd93119
Sharing dat: 24 files (383 MB)

0 connections | Download 0 B/s Upload 0 B/s

Importing 528 files to Archive (165 MB/s)
[=-----------------------------------------] 3%
ADD: data/expn_cd.csv (403 MB / 920 MB)
```

#### Syncing to Network

```
dat sync [<dir>] [--no-import] [--no-watch]
```

Start sharing your dat archive over the network.
Sync will import new or updated files since you last ran `create` or `sync`.
Sync watches files for changes and imports updated files.

* Use `--no-import` to not import any new or updated files.
* Use `--no-watch` to not watch directory for changes. `--import` must be true for `--watch` to work.

#### Ignoring Files

By default, Dat will ignore any files in a `.datignore` file, similar to git.
Each file should be separated by a newline.
Dat also ignores all hidden folders and files.

Dat uses [dat-ignore] to decide if a file should be ignored.
Supports pattern wildcards (`/*.png`) and directory-wildcards (`/**/cache`).

#### Selecting Files

By default, Dat will download all files.
If you want to only download a subset, you can create a `.datdownload` file which downloads only the files and folders specified.
Each should be separated by a newline.


### Downloading

Start downloading by running the `clone` command.
This creates a folder, downloads the content and metadata, and a `.dat` folder inside.
Once you started the download, you can resume using `clone` or the other download commands.

```
dat clone <link> [<dir>] [--temp]
```

Clone a remote dat archive to a local folder.
This will create a folder with the key name if no folder is specified.

#### Downloading via `dat.json` key

You can use a `dat.json` file to clone also.
This is useful when combining Dat and git, for example.
To clone a dat you can specify the path to a folder containing a `dat.json`:

```
git clone git@github.com:joehand/dat-clone-sparse-test.git
dat clone ./dat-clone-sparse-test
```

This will download the dat specified in the `dat.json` file.

#### Updating Downloaded Archives

Once a dat is clone, you can run either `dat pull` or `dat sync` in the folder to update the archive.

```
dat pull [<dir>]
```

Update a cloned dat archive with the latest files and exit.

```
dat sync [<dir>]
```

Download latest files and keep connection open to continue updating as remote source is updated.

### Shortcut commands

* `dat <link> <dir>` will run `dat clone` for new dats or resume the existing dat in `<dir>`
* `dat <dir>` is the same as running `dat sync <dir>`

### Key Management & Moving dats

`dat keys` provides a few commands to help you move or backup your dats.

Writing to a dat requires the secret key, stored in the `~/.dat` folder.
You can export and import these keys between dats.
First, clone your dat to the new location:

* (original) `dat share`
* (duplicate) `dat clone <link>`

Then transfer the secret key:

* (original) `dat keys export` - copy the secret key printed out.
* (duplicate) `dat keys import` - this will prompt you for the secret key, paste it in here.

## Troubleshooting

We've provided some troubleshooting tips based on issues users have seen.
Please [open an issue][new-issue] or ask us in our [chat room][gitter-chat] if you need help troubleshooting and it is not covered here.

If you have trouble sharing/downloading in a directory with a `.dat` folder, try deleting it and running the command again.

#### Check Your Dat Version

Knowing the version is really helpful if you run into any bugs, and will help us troubleshoot your issue.

Check your Dat version:

```
dat -v
```

You should see the Dat semantic version printed, e.g. `13.1.2`.

### Installation Issues

#### Node & npm

To use the Dat command line tool you will need to have [node and npm installed][install-node-npm].
Make sure those are installed correctly before installing Dat.
You can check the version of each:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Global Install

The `-g` option installs Dat globally, allowing you to run it as a command.
Make sure you installed with that option.

* If you receive an `EACCES` error, read [this guide][fixing-npm-permissions] on fixing npm permissions.
* If you receive an `EACCES` error, you may also install Dat with sudo: `sudo npm install -g dat`.
* Have other installation issues? Let us know, you can [open an issue][new-issue] or ask us in our [chat room][gitter-chat].

### Debugging Output

If you are having trouble with a specific command, run with the debug environment variable set to `dat` (and optionally also `dat-node`).
This will help us debug any issues:

```
DEBUG=dat,dat-node dat clone dat://<link> dir
```

### Networking Issues

Networking capabilities vary widely with each computer, network, and configuration.
Whenever you run Dat there are several steps to share or download files with peers:

1. Discovering Peers
2. Connecting to Peers
3. Sending & Receiving Data

With successful use, Dat will show `Connected to 1 peer` after connection.
If you never see a peer connected, your network may be restricting discovery or connection.
Please try using the `dat --doctor` command (see below) between the two computers not connecting. This will help troubleshoot the networks.

* Dat may [have issues][dat#503] connecting if you are using iptables.

#### Dat Doctor

We've included a tool to identify network issues with Dat, the Dat doctor.
The Dat doctor will run two tests:

1. Attempt to connect to a public server running a Dat peer.
2. Attempt a direct connection between two peers. You will need to run the command on both the computers you are trying to share data between.

Start the doctor by running:

```
dat doctor
```

For direct connection tests, the doctor will print out a command to run on the other computer, `dat doctor <64-character-string>`.
The doctor will run through the key steps in the process of sharing data between computers to help identify the issue.
