Dat is a protocol for sharing data between computers. By making sure changes in data are transparent, everyone receives only the data they want, and connecting computers directly (rather than using a cloud server), Dat powers communities building next-generation Web.

The *Dat Project* helps shepherd community efforts surrounding the Dat protocol.
